Proof on concept
Based on MAME 0.78

Build with 'make MAMEOS=libretro'.
Tested for osx and linux.

Might have errors on 64-bit. (Seems to work but there's a lot of casting pointers to 32-bits).
The output file will always be 'mame.exe' but it will be a proper library.
You will get an error at the end of the build as it tries to run mame.exe, which isn't a program binary.
When using concurrent building you may get an error that it can't create certain object files, just rerun make it it happens.
No libretro Joystick support (Keyboard only).
No Sound support.

To use you must have a system directory set with your games in the 'rom' folder. The driver name loaded is based on the name of the file you load.

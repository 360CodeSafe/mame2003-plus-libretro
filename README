Proof on concept
Based on MAME 0.78

Build with 'make MAMEOS=libretro'.
Tested for osx and linux.

Will have error on 64-bit platforms.
The output file will always be 'mame.exe' but it will be a proper library.
You will get an error at the end of the build as it tries to run mame.exe, which isn't a program binary.
When using concurrent building you may get an error that it can't create certain object files, just rerun make it it happens.
Only player 1's retro pad works.

To use you must have a system directory set with your games in the 'rom' folder. The driver name loaded is based on the name of the file you load.

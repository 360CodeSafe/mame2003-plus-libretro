Proof on concept
Based on MAME 0.78

Tested for OS X, linux and Android (arm-v7a).

Will have errors on 64-bit platforms. Will have errors on platforms without unaligned memory access support.
When using concurrent building you may get an error that it can't create certain object files, just rerun make it it happens.
Only player 1's retro pad works.

To use you must have a system directory set with your games in the 'rom' folder. The driver name loaded is based on the name of the file you load.

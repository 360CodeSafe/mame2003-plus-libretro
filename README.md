## What Arcade romsets work with mame2003-plus and how to build them

**mame2003-plus was originally built from the MAME 0.78 codebase, meaning that 95% or more of MAME 0.78 romsets will work as-is in mame2003-plus, where they immediately benefit from its bugfixes and other improvements.** In order to play the new games and games which received ROM updates in mame2003-plus, you will need to find or build the correct romsets.

> **What is a romset?**
> Arcade games are packaged as zip files, most of which are composed of more than one individual 'ROM' files. That is why some resources refer to an individual arcade game as a ROM (like people use to describe a zipped game cartridge ROM) while other resources refer to an individual game as a ROM set, ROMset, or romset.
